Sure, here are ten scenario-based questions for you to brush up on your skills with a small dataset:

1. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer information such as name, age, gender, and email address. You need to filter out customers who are under 18 years old. How would you do it using PySpark?

2. Scenario: You have a dataset with sales information including product ID, quantity sold, and price per unit. You need to calculate the total revenue generated from each product. How would you approach this using PySpark?

3. Scenario: You have a dataset containing user activity logs from an application, including user ID, timestamp, and action performed (e.g., login, logout, purchase). You need to find the most active users based on the number of actions performed within a specific time period. How would you do it using PySpark?

4. Scenario: You have a dataset containing sensor data from IoT devices, including device ID, timestamp, and sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity). You need to calculate the average temperature recorded by each device. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?

5. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer orders, including order ID, customer ID, and order date. You need to find the total number of orders placed by each customer. How would you do it using PySpark?

6. Scenario: You have a dataset containing employee information, including employee ID, department, and salary. You need to find the highest-paid employee in each department. How would you approach this using PySpark?

7. Scenario: You have a dataset containing website traffic logs, including IP address, timestamp, and page visited. You need to identify the most popular pages based on the number of visits. How would you do it using PySpark?

8. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer feedback data, including feedback ID, customer ID, and satisfaction score. You need to calculate the average satisfaction score for each customer. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?

9. Scenario: You have a dataset containing product reviews, including review ID, product ID, and review text. You need to identify the most frequently mentioned products based on the number of reviews. How would you approach this using PySpark?

10. Scenario: You have a dataset containing stock price data, including stock symbol, date, and closing price. You need to calculate the average closing price for each stock symbol. How would you do it using PySpark?

These scenarios cover a range of common data engineering tasks and should help you revise your skills with PySpark and related technologies.
