Sure, here are ten scenario-based questions for you to brush up on your skills with a small dataset:

1. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer information such as name, age, gender, and email address. You need to filter out customers who are under 18 years old. How would you do it using PySpark?

2. Scenario: You have a dataset with sales information including product ID, quantity sold, and price per unit. You need to calculate the total revenue generated from each product. How would you approach this using PySpark?

3. Scenario: You have a dataset containing user activity logs from an application, including user ID, timestamp, and action performed (e.g., login, logout, purchase). You need to find the most active users based on the number of actions performed within a specific time period. How would you do it using PySpark?

4. Scenario: You have a dataset containing sensor data from IoT devices, including device ID, timestamp, and sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity). You need to calculate the average temperature recorded by each device. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?

5. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer orders, including order ID, customer ID, and order date. You need to find the total number of orders placed by each customer. How would you do it using PySpark?

6. Scenario: You have a dataset containing employee information, including employee ID, department, and salary. You need to find the highest-paid employee in each department. How would you approach this using PySpark?

7. Scenario: You have a dataset containing website traffic logs, including IP address, timestamp, and page visited. You need to identify the most popular pages based on the number of visits. How would you do it using PySpark?

8. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer feedback data, including feedback ID, customer ID, and satisfaction score. You need to calculate the average satisfaction score for each customer. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?

9. Scenario: You have a dataset containing product reviews, including review ID, product ID, and review text. You need to identify the most frequently mentioned products based on the number of reviews. How would you approach this using PySpark?

10. Scenario: You have a dataset containing stock price data, including stock symbol, date, and closing price. You need to calculate the average closing price for each stock symbol. How would you do it using PySpark?

Certainly, here are ten more scenario-based questions along with hints:

11. Scenario: You have a dataset containing student exam scores, including student ID, subject, and score. You need to calculate the average score for each subject. How would you approach this using PySpark?
   Hint: Use the `groupBy` transformation to group the data by subject and then use the `avg` function to compute the average score.

12. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer transaction data, including transaction ID, customer ID, and transaction amount. You need to find the total transaction amount for each customer. How would you do it using PySpark?
   Hint: Use the `groupBy` transformation to group the data by customer ID and then use the `sum` function to calculate the total transaction amount.

13. Scenario: You have a dataset containing employee attendance records, including employee ID, date, and attendance status (e.g., present, absent). You need to calculate the percentage of days each employee was present. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?
   Hint: Use the `groupBy` transformation to group the data by employee ID and then calculate the percentage of days with the attendance status "present".

14. Scenario: You have a dataset containing product inventory information, including product ID, quantity in stock, and price per unit. You need to calculate the total value of each product in stock. How would you do it using PySpark?
   Hint: Calculate the total value by multiplying the quantity in stock by the price per unit and then group the data by product ID.

15. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer churn data, including customer ID, churn status (e.g., churned, active), and subscription start date. You need to identify customers who churned within the first 30 days of their subscription. How would you approach this using PySpark?
   Hint: Filter the dataset to include only customers with a churn status of "churned" and whose subscription start date is within the first 30 days.

16. Scenario: You have a dataset containing website clickstream data, including session ID, timestamp, and page URL. You need to calculate the average session duration for each session. How would you do it using PySpark?
   Hint: Use window functions to partition the data by session ID and calculate the duration between the minimum and maximum timestamps.

17. Scenario: You have a dataset containing employee performance reviews, including employee ID, review date, and performance score. You need to calculate the average performance score for each employee over the past year. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?
   Hint: Filter the dataset to include only reviews from the past year and then group the data by employee ID to calculate the average performance score.

18. Scenario: You have a dataset containing weather data, including location, date, and temperature. You need to find the maximum temperature recorded in each location. How would you approach this using PySpark?
   Hint: Use the `groupBy` transformation to group the data by location and then use the `max` function to calculate the maximum temperature.

19. Scenario: You have a dataset containing customer support ticket data, including ticket ID, customer ID, and ticket status (e.g., open, closed). You need to calculate the average resolution time for each customer. How would you accomplish this using PySpark?
   Hint: Calculate the resolution time by subtracting the ticket creation date from the ticket closure date and then group the data by customer ID to calculate the average resolution time.

20. Scenario: You have a dataset containing social media posts, including post ID, user ID, and number of likes. You need to identify the top 10 users with the highest total number of likes on their posts. How would you do it using PySpark?
   Hint: Group the data by user ID and calculate the sum of likes for each user, then sort the results to find the top 10 users with the highest total likes.
